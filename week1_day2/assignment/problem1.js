/* Problem 1: Reassigning a let Variable
In this problem, you should create a variable with let, assign it a number, and print its value with console.log. Next, change the value of this variable to a different number and print it again. Observe how let allows you to reassign the variable without errors.
Explanation: A variable declared with let is reassignable, meaning you can update its value. Use console.log to verify what the variable holds at each step.
Hint: let myNumber = 5; console.log(myNumber); myNumber = 10; console.log(myNumber);
Expected Output: You will see the initial value (for example, 5) printed first, and then the updated value (for example, 10) printed next.

let number = 1;
console.log(number); // output 1
number = 2;
console.log(number); // output 2
